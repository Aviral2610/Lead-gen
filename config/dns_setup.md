# DNS Setup Guide for Cold Email Infrastructure

## Overview

Every sending domain needs SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records configured correctly
before sending any cold emails. Incorrect DNS = emails go to spam.

## Domain Strategy

Purchase 3-5 secondary domains similar to your main brand:
- Main: `acme.com`
- Secondary: `acme-team.com`, `getacme.io`, `acmeHQ.com`

For each domain, create 2-3 Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 email accounts.

## Required DNS Records (per domain)

### 1. SPF Record

**Type:** TXT
**Host:** `@`
**Value:**
```
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

For Microsoft 365:
```
v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com ~all
```

### 2. DKIM Record

**Type:** TXT
**Host:** `google._domainkey` (Google) or `selector1._domainkey` (Microsoft)
**Value:** Generated by your email provider — copy from Google Admin / Microsoft Admin

### 3. DMARC Record

**Type:** TXT
**Host:** `_dmarc`
**Value (start with monitoring):**
```
v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

After 2-4 weeks of monitoring, tighten to:
```
v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@yourdomain.com
```

### 4. Custom Tracking Domain (Instantly)

**Type:** CNAME
**Host:** `track` (or `email`)
**Value:** Provided by Instantly (e.g., `custom.instantly.ai`)

## Verification

Use these tools to verify your DNS records:
- [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx) - SPF, DKIM, DMARC check
- [Mail-Tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/) - Send a test email for scoring
- [Google Admin Toolbox](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/) - MX check
